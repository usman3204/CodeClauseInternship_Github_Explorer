# CodeClauseInternship_Github_Explorer
GitHub Explorer is a web application that allows users to search for GitHub profiles and view detailed information about them. Users can enter a GitHub username to see their avatar, bio, follower and following counts, as well as their public repositories. The application uses GitHub's API to fetch and display this information dynamically.
